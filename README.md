## Description

I was motivated to create this project because it gives me a real world scenario where I can view data and be able to alter it through insomnia.
The reason I built this project was because I wanted to learn how to use insomnia and learn more about ORM that can show me data that connects with mysql and javascript.
I can easily alter, delete, and find all data of specific things inside my api.
I learned how to use insomnia, and understood the relationship between the data and how I don't need to have a bunch of tables through sql files.

## Installation

install the code through cloning, make sure to install all of the files including dotenv, express, mysql2 and sequelize. also install insomnia to work it.

## Usage

log into mysql and source the schema first, then on another terminal, seed the code through index.js, then npm start. Go into the insomnia and look at the side bar. make necessary changes to customize it, then find by id you would have to add a number at the end before sending.

## Credits

I cloned the original data from https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella.
